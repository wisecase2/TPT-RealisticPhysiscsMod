v1.0:
 - Completed most of the elements that can be destroyed with 4 transition states (solid, liquid, gas and plsm).
 - changed PLUT, URAN fission method.
 - The penetration power of PROT and NEUT has been changed.
 - Added latent heat.
 - The transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state changes the pressure on the cell.
 - changed air update, asymmetry repaired.

v2.0:
 - Added broken state
 - Added the broken state for non-breaking elements, and each of them has breaking strength, which also varies with thickness. Added input key "m", which switches the mode of placing these elements
in broken state or not (tmp2 = 1000).
 - fixed infinity salt in sltw.
 - Added gamma rays.
 - AMTR now releases gamma rays when it touches matter.
 - RWST, PLUT, URAN now is radioactive, release gamma rays.
 - Now GOLD reflect neutrons.
 - Added solid state for HYGN and NBLE.
 - Fixed many other minor bugs.

v2.3:
 - Added ASPR, powered sprk, spark every frame. Tmp: 1 -> pscn, 2 -> inwr, 3 -> replace mod, exclusive for cray, and others like normal conductors.
 - Filt has 17 more modes.
 - Now NEUT slows down in the water (all states).
 - Fixed black hole shadow bug.
 - CONV now has a new mode, where you change the element type without affecting speed when your tmp2 equals 1.

v3.0:
 - Stack editing.

v4.0
 - Added BLCK, indestructible, replaces DMND.
 - DMND is now destructible, with similar properties to COAL, but with much greater resistance. It can be made with COAL or BCOL with high pressure and temperature.
 - Improvements in explosives.
 - Fixed COAL that does not burn, with improvements.
 - Fixed the BRMT in the transition of states.
 - Fixed the bug of "empty" produced by the movements of the particles in the visualization of particles stacks.
 - CLNE, BCLN, PCLN, PBCN with tmp = 1, produces solids in a broken state.
 - The gamma ray temperature is now shown in Kelvin.
